print("Hello Python world!")



# Chapter 1 Summary:
# In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed Python on your system if it wasnâ€™t already there. You also installed a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran snippets of Python code in a terminal session, and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
