# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what you’ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter.
# - Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote two times:
# -print the contents once by reading in the entire file, 
# -and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.

from pathlib import Path

path = Path("week_4\Chapter_10\learning_python.txt")
contents = path.read_text()
#print(contents)
lines = contents.splitlines()
print("This is what Im Learning about Python:")
for line in lines:
