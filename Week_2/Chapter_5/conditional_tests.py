# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
#   -Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
#   -Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
